## I am a:

- world traveler
- book lover
- fic writer
- steam gamer
- humanities grad turned **software engineer**!

Change is my friend, and so is curiousity.

I love to make && re-make things.

I'm happiest when I am figuring out how things fit together - in the real world and in the shell!

<h3><em>fun fact:</em></h3>

- My favorite place I've visited so far is Hell Valley in Hokkaido.
- It's also where I took my favorite photo:
