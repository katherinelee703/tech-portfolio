title: Studying System Design
---

I've been a little apprehensive about system design since we first practiced whiteboarding these concepts during Bootcamp. I was intimidated by how broad the topic was, and by how many different technologies you could choose to include or exclude in your design. The tradeoffs seemed endless, and technologies to choose from numerous.

So instead of sitting on my worries any longer, I decided to work through the book "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu.

It was extremely helpful, and really broke down the more complex concepts into manageable mini-lessons. It didn't matter that this was content I was seeing for the very first time - the author made it very digestible.

I think my main takeaway from this book was to _ask questions_. Since system design questions are naturally open-ended, it really helped to understand what kinds of questions to ask at the very beginning to narrow down the scope of what I can feasibly accomplish designing in a brief 45 minute to 1 hour time slot.

My other favorite part of this book was the "back-of-the-envelope" estimations section. It showed me that there's no need to get nervous about "doing math" because the math required is very simple. Even for very large numbers.

I can see myself coming back to this book from time to time, perhaps when I'm starting to design more of my own larger-scale projects in the future.
