title: Taking a Masterclass on Udemy
---

I've found that Udemy courses tend to really fit my learning style, and I cannot recommend enough the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass</a> taught by Colt Steele.

For any bootcamp grad who felt they wanted more time and practice with technical interview style problems or even just data structures concepts in general, this class really fills that gap. Whether you're learning this material for the first time, or are worried you might be getting rusty, you can get up to speed quickly and do tons of coding practice.

You can choose to work on only the topics you need help with, or just do the whole course front to back. The thing that really sets this course apart from just spending time on <a href="https://www.leetcode.com" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">Leetcode</a> or finishing the whole <a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> practice section is the time spent on explanations of the various Time and Space Complexities for the given problems. This part really helps you understand the tradeoffs you will make while trying to solve a problem a certain way - it also gives you great talking points for when you need explain why you're taking a certain approach on an interview question!

If you're wishing there were such a thing as a Coding Bootcamp Part 2, this is it!
Catching this course on sale was my biggest steal of 2020 so far!
