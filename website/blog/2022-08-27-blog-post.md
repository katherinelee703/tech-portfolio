title: Learning TypeScript
---

So, I came back to Udemy for another course! I wanted to become more proficient at TypeScript for work, so I was excited to see that the instructor I wrote about in a previous post had opened a new class called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-typescript/" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastering TypeScript - 2022 Edition</a>

I was able to get through it in just 1 day and it has already made a world of difference for me. And the best part was that my company let me expense it through our learning benefit :)

```typescript
interface LearningBenefit {
  readonly budgetRemaining: number;
  coursesCompleted: string[];
  nextCourses: string[];
  makingProgress: boolean;
}

let myLearningBenefit: LearningBenefit = {
  budgetRemaining: 1000000,
  coursesCompleted: ['Mastering TypeScript', 'Algos & Data Structures'],
  nextCourses: ['React Hooks', 'React Testing Library', 'React Query'],
  makingProgress: true,
};
```

It was also nice to use the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript Playground</a> feature, and I found the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">Docs</a> to be very clear and helpful.
