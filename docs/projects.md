## Shelter in Pets

<h1></h1>

### Summary

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the various social distancing protocols are preventing many people from visiting shelters to adopt pets.

Our smart mobile app solves this problem by letting users search for adoptable dogs from the comfort and safety of their homes.

It matches user-uploaded dog images to similar adoptable dogs, allows a user to conduct filtered searches based on desired traits,

and even recommends adoptable dogs based on the user’s in-app activity.

## Cutest Coffee Clicker

<h1></h1>

### Summary

A game where all you have to do is click (or touch) the cup of coffee! It's oddly addictive...

This is an homage to the 2013 hit game "Cookie Clicker"

The story goes that in a single evening in August of 2013, French web developer Julien "Orteil" Thiennot coded a simple browser-based game called "[Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)", hoping to direct some traffic to his personal website while also having some fun. Overnight, the game attracted some 50,000 players. Within several months it was garnering 1.5 million page views per day. What began as a one-night project — and something of a joke — is now considered to be a founding entry in the genre of ["idle" or "incremental" games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game), which account for a not insignificant percentage of the \$550 million in revenue generated annually by casual, mobile video games.
