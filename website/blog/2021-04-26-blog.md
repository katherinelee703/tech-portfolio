title: My Favorite Problem So Far
---

<p>I’ve been working through a new algorithms and data structures book recently, and I saw a problem that has been loosely appearing in my imagination on and off for some time.</p>

<p>When I read the description, I was immediately excited because it stated that general idea in very clear terms.</p></br>

<p><strong>It goes like this:</strong></p></br>

<ul><li>Imagine a set of cities arranged in order.

<li>You need to drive through all of the cities once, and stop at the same city you started from - ie make a full circle.

<li>You will refill your car’s gas tank at each city.

<li>But each city only has a certain amount of gas you can have.

<li>It is given that at least one city will work as the starting point.</ul></br>

<p><strong>How do you find out which starting city ensures you won’t run out of fuel at any point during your trip?</strong></p></br>

<p>I’d been thinking of this problem more in terms of how to beat a level in a game without running out of stamina or moves, but it’s much clearer when it’s phrased as the “gas up” problem.</p>

<p>As the book said, it was very easy to mistake this problem as a greedy algorithm problem. Or, in other words, a math-y “best gas-to-mileage ratio = starting point” problem.</p>

<p>But it isn't.</p></br>

<p>You can solve this problem in O(n) time, where n is the number of cities.</p>

<p>You can imagine it like a line graph. Then all you need to do is pass over each city once and calculate the gas used up by the time you reach the next city.</p>

<p>You’re not looking for the best gas-to-mileage ratio, or trying to do recursion to narrow down the choices.</p>

<p>All you’re looking for is the moment when you have the LEAST gas upon entry to any given city. When computing this, it also doesn’t even matter which city you start with, because the city that is the minimum for ONE graph will be the minimum for ALL graphs.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that starting from there will ensure you can make the full trip without running out of gas.</p></br>

<p><strong>Here’s some quick illustrations I made:</strong></p></br>

<p>Isn’t that cool!?</p></br>

<p>Here's my code for it if you want to check it out~</p></br>

```
// You will be given 3 Inputs like these:

let gas = [50,20,5,30,25,10,10];
let dist = [900,600,200,400,600,200,100];
let mpg = 20;


function gasUp(gas, dist, mpg) {
  let gasAtDepart = {};
  let gasBeforeEntry = {};
  let currGas = 0;
  let gasLeft = 0;
  let runningMin = Infinity;
  let start;

  for (let i = 0; i < dist.length; i++) {
    if (gasLeft < runningMin) {
      runningMin = gasLeft;
      start = i;
    }
    gasBeforeEntry[i] = gasLeft;
    currGas += gas[i];
    gasAtDepart[i] = currGas;
    let gasUsed = dist[i] / mpg;
    gasLeft = currGas - gasUsed;
    currGas = gasLeft;
  }
  console.log("gas at depart:", gasAtDepart);
  console.log("gas on entry:", gasBeforeEntry);
  console.log("min:", runningMin);
  console.log("min index (start idx):", start);

  return `start from city at index ${start}`;

}

gasUp(gas, dist, mpg);
```
