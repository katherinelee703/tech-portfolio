A world-traveling, book-loving, webtoon-translating, steam-gaming, humanities grad turned software engineer. I love hearing about cool new apps and figuring out how things fit together - in the real world and in the shell! I like to think of things as stories, and believe programs (just like characters) deserve their own special type of character development!
